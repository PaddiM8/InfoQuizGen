               <h2>Seamless Transitions</h2>
               <p>Quizzes made with InfoQuiz have high-performant and smooth CSS transitions.</p>

               <h2>Knowledge based</h2>
               <p>The point of InfoQuizzes isn't to get as many correct answers as possible.
                  Instead, it's about learning as much as possible. Hence the lack of points.</p>

               <h2>Sources</h2>
               <p>Quizzes are expected to have a list of sources used for each question,
                  and the quiz-builder makes it easy to do so.</h2>
